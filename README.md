# RadPool
Device to monitor the current pool temperatures at different levels.

With a pool cover on it's interesting to see how the temperature at the top of the pool climbs while the rest stays level. Once the pump kicks in the temperature throughout the pool normalises within minutes.

Pool is an above ground pool and approximately 1.1m deep:
Top sensor: 1m
Middle sensor: 0.6m
Bottom sensor: 0.2m

TODO: floating sensor approximately 1cm from the top. Reasong being is when you feel the temperature of the water right under the cover it feels like it would be 50c+
